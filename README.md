# MyMoon AR Android Application

## What is MyMoon?
MyMoon is an Android application that utilised both Augmented Reality and Text-to-Speech in order to teach users about the Moon and its surface. This is my final year project in Software Development so this project will be ongoing until I graduate.


## What will MyMoon do?
- Use the 3 segments of edutainment; Educator, Multimedia and Game Design to create an effective learning environment
- Display 3D models of the Moon and the Earth using Android smartphone
- 3D models have an overlay of interesting spots the user can walk/zoom into.
- Display and calculate Moon Phases within 200 years of todays date.
- Link Valiable videos of space missions, facts about the moon and interesting data.
- Utilise Text-to-Speech Libary to help aid with the overall learning.
