# MyMoon AR Android Application

## What is MyMoon?
MyMoon is an Android application that utilised both Augmented Reality and Text-to-Speech in order to teach users about the Moon and its surface. This is my final year project in Software Development so this project will be ongoing until I graduate.


## What will MyMoon do?
- Use the 3 segments of edutainment; Educator, Multimedia and Game Design to create an effective learning environment
- Display 3D models of the Moon and the Earth using Android smartphone
- 3D models have an overlay of interesting spots the user can walk/zoom into.
- Display and calculate Moon Phases within 200 years of todays date.
- Link Valiable videos of space missions, facts about the moon and interesting data.
- Utilise Text-to-Speech Libary to help aid with the overall learning.

+   Notes                                                  

- You will need to have Android Studio in order to open the 
  project file completly.
- You may be able to view the source code using another IDE or 
  an application like NotePad++, but will be limited with 
  navigation and UI.
- The emulators on Android Studio will NOT be able to run 
  ARCore Libary down to compatability errors, so you will need 
  to run on a compatabile device.
	- Will work on the following devices:
		https://developers.google.com/ar/devices
- Developed using my OnePlus 7 Pro phone.
- Cloud database, Firebase, has been set up to allow all devices
  to read so no issues will arrise there.

+   Steps to open Source Code                                 

1) If you wish to install the application directly you may do 
   so by sending the APK file to your personal Android device. 
   You will need to configure your device to allow 
   applications to be installed outside of the Google Play 
   store. My application does not, nor ever will have any 
   Daemon or scripts that will harm or effect your personal 
   data.

2) If you do not want to install the APK directly you will need 
   to have Android Studio installed. You will be able to use 
   an emulator on Android Studio to view most of the 
   application but not the Augmented Reality section.
REF: https://developer.android.com/studio/
   
3) To get an emulator running on Android studio navigate to 
   Tools->AVD Manager->Create Virtual Device->
   "Select any latest Device"->
   "Select the latest Version of Android available"->Finish.

   Once You have an Emulator you can run the application on 
   that device you have created.

+   Steps to open 3D Models outside of Android device         

 - You may open the entire 3D models using Blender. Blender is 
   a free downloadable software that I used to create these 
   models.
REF: https://www.blender.org/download/

 - Windows 10 machines have a software called "3D Viewer" that 
   can be used to open the models as well
